Adds a few useful docking ports to Kerbal Space Program

Need to have both a parachute and a docking port on your vessel, but don't want to resort to gluing radial parachutes on the side of your capsule? Want to connect two 1.875 meter wide parts together without an awkward narrow passage? With this small part mod, you can. It introduces a modular docking port and parachute system for the 0.625 meter wide and 1.25 meter wide sizes. It also adds a 1.875 meter wide docking port, something that I'm surprised no one else seems to have done yet, at least to my knowledge.

Due to some technical and aesthetic limitations, the parachute and docking port are separate parts, with three custom parachute modules snapping into the new modular docking port parts with 3 way radial symmetry to provide an integrated and streamlined parachute and docking port system.

No mods are required, but ReStock is highly recommended, since the docking ports were designed to seamlessly connect with the revamped ReStock docking ports.

Please let me know if you run into any issues while using this mod. I try to test things thoroughly, but it can be easy to miss things, so feedback is greatly appreciated.
